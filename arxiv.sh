# Even though the file exists, arXiv still states the following:
# "We do not run bibtex in the auto-TeXing procedure. If you use bibtex, you must compile the .bbl file on your computer then include that in your uploaded source files. See using bibtex.
# The name of the .bbl file must match the name of the main .tex file for the system to process the references correctly."
# If the ms.bbl file is there, just ignore this problem.
