\abstract{
    Motivated by \ldbcsnb, LDBC FinBench (Financial Benchmark) intends to define
    a benchmark characterized by special data and query patterns in financial
    industry to test graph database systems to make the evaluation of graph
    databases representative, reliable and comparable, especially in financial
    scenarios.

    Similar to \ldbcsnb, LDBC FinBench consists of two workloads that focus on
    different functionalities: the Transaction workload and the Analytics
    workload (future work for now). This document contains the definition of
    workloads including a detailed description of the datasets and queries, and
    also an explanation about the workflow to use the benchmark.
