\abstract{
    Motivated by LDBC SNB(Social Network Benchmark), LDBC FinBench(Financial Benchmark) intends to define a benchmark
    characterized with special data and query patterns in financial industry to test graph database systems to make
    the evaluation of graph databases representative, reliable and comparable, especially in financial scenarios.

    Similar to SNB, LDBC FinBench consists of two workloads that focus on different functionalities: the Transaction
    workload and the Analytics workload (future work for now). This document contains the definition of workloads including
    a detailed description of the datasets and queries, and also an explanation about the workflow to use the benchmark.
