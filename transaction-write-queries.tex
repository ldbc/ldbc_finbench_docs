In write queries, there are mainly two types of queries, inserts and deletes. In
real systems, there are deletion operations besides delete operations. Deletion
operations limit the architecture that can be used by a system. On the other
hand, systems are supposed to provide API for users to express delete operations
no matter with high-level structured language like GQL and openCypher or
low-level storage layer API.
