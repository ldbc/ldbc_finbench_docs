\snbCPSection{8.6}{LANG}{Handling paths}

\paragraph{Description.}

Handling paths as first-class citizens is one of the key distinguishing features of graph database
systems~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/AnglesABBFGLPPS18}. Hence, additionally to
reachability-style checks, a language should be able to express
queries that operate on elements of a path, \eg calculate a score on each edge
of the path.
Also, some use cases specify uniqueness constraints on paths~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/AnglesABHRV17}:
\emph{arbitrary path},
\emph{shortest path},
\emph{no-repeated-node semantics} (also known as \emph{simple paths}), and
\emph{no-repeated-edge semantics} (also known as \emph{trails}).
Other variants are also used in rare cases, such as \emph{maximal} (non-expandable) or \emph{minimal} (non-contractable) paths.

\paragraph{Note on terminology.}

The \emph{Glossary of graph theory terms} page of Wikipedia\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms}} defines \emph{paths} as follows: ``A path may either be a walk (a sequence of nodes and edges, with both endpoints of an edge appearing adjacent to it in the sequence) or a simple path (a walk with no repetitions of nodes or edges), depending on the source.''
In this work, we use the first definition, which is more common in modern graph database systems and is also followed in a recent survey on graph query languages~\cite{DBLP:journals/csur/AnglesABHRV17}.
