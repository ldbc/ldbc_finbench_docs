\newCPSection{7.11}{QEXE}{Intermediate Result Propagation}

When calculating some final share or final ratio values, there is a common
pattern in computing that each value need to calculate with the value in last
hop which is similar to propagation, (\eg label propagation). To make the
computation more efficient, some intermediate results should be cached to reuse
in the next computing stage.
