\snbCPSection{3.2}{STORAGE}{Dimensional clustering}

This choke point tests suitability of the identifiers assigned to entities by
the storage system to better exploit data locality. A data model where each
entity has a unique synthetic identifier, \eg RDF or graph models, has some
choice in assigning a value to this identifier. The properties of the entity
being identified may affect this, \eg type (label), other dependent properties,
\eg geographic location, date, position in a hierarchy, etc., depending on the
application. Such identifier choice may create locality which in turn improves
efficiency of compression or index access.
