\cpSection{3.2}{STORAGE}{Dimensional clustering}

This choke point tests suitability of the identifiers assigned to entities by the storage system to better exploit data locality. A data model where each entity has a unique synthetic identifier,
\eg RDF or graph models, has some choice in assigning a value to this identifier.
The properties of the entity being identified may affect this, \eg type (label), other dependent properties,
\eg geographic location, date, position in a hierarchy, etc., depending on the application. Such identifier choice may create locality which in turn improves efficiency of compression or index access.
