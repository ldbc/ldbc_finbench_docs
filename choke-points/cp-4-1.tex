\tpcCPSection[4.2a]{4.1}{QOPT}{Common subexpression elimination}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to detect common sub-expressions and reuse their results. A basic technique helpful in multiple queries is common subexpression elimination (CSE).
CSE should recognize also that \lstinline{avg} aggregates can be derived afterwards by dividing a \lstinline{sum} by the \lstinline{count} when those have been computed.
