\tpcCPSection[1.1]{1.2}{QEXE}{High cardinality group-by performance}

This choke point tests the ability of the execution engine to parallelize
group-by operations with a large number of groups. Some queries require
performing large group-by operations. In such a case, if an aggregation produces
a significant number of groups, intra-query parallelization can be exploited as
each thread may make its own partial aggregation. Then, to produce the result,
these have to be re-aggregated. In order to avoid this, the tuples entering the
aggregation operator may be partitioned by a hash of the grouping key and be
sent to the appropriate partition. Each partition would have its own thread so
that only that thread would write the aggregation, hence avoiding costly
critical sections as well. A high cardinality distinct modifier in a query is a
special case of this choke point. It is amenable to the same solution with
intra-query parallelization and partitioning as the group-by. We further note
that scale-out systems have an extra incentive for partitioning since this will
distribute the CPU and memory pressure over multiple machines, yielding better
platform utilization and scalability.
