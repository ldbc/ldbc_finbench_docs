\tpcCPSection[3.3]{3.1}{QOPT}{Detecting correlation}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to detect data
correlations and exploiting them. If a schema rewards creating clustered
indices, the question then is which of the date or data columns to use as key.
In fact it should not matter which column is used, as range-propagation between
correlated attributes of the same table is relatively easy. One way is through
the creation of multi-attribute histograms after detection of attribute
correlation. With MinMax indices, range-predicates on any column can be
translated into qualifying tuple position ranges. If an attribute value is
correlated with tuple position, this reduces the area to scan roughly equally to
predicate selectivity.
