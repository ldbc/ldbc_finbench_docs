\tpcCPSection[4.2d]{4.2}{QOPT}{Complex boolean expression joins and selections}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to reorder the
execution of boolean expressions to improve the performance. Some boolean
expressions are complex, with possibilities for alternative optimal evaluation
orders. For instance, the optimizer may reorder conjunctions to test first those
conditions with larger selectivity~\cite{DBLP:conf/vldb/Moerkotte98}.
