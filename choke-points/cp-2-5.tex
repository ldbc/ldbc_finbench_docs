\snbCPSection{2.5}{QEXE}{Worst-case optimal joins}

This choke point tests the query engine's ability to use multi-way, worst-case
optimal joins to evaluate cyclic queries which are required to efficiently
compute some dense subgraphs such as the triangle, the 4-cycle, and the diamond
(4-cycle with a cross-edge). The absence of multi-way joins (\eg in systems
which only support binary joins), implies that join performance will be provably
suboptimal for cyclic queries.
