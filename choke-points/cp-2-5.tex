\cpSection{2.5}{QEXE}{Worst-case optimal joins}

This choke point tests the query engine's ability to use multi-way, worst-case optimal joins to evaluate cyclic queries which are required to efficiently compute some dense subgraphs such as the triangle, the 4-cycle, and the diamond (4-cycle with a cross-edge).
The absence of multi-way joins (\eg in systems which only support binary joins), implies that join performance will be provably suboptimal for cyclic queries.
