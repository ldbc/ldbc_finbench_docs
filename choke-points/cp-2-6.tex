\snbCPSection{2.6}{QEXE}{Factorized query execution}

Query results produced by many-to-many joins often have redundancies when
represented as tuples. Factorization~\cite{DBLP:journals/sigmod/OlteanuS16}
provides a more compact (relational) representation by eliminating repetitions,
while still allowing some operations (\eg aggregation) to be performed without
flattening the relation.
