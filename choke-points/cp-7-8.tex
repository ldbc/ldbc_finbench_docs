\snbCPSection{7.8}{QEXE}{Reachability between disconnected components}

For path finding queries, the result is often that the specified path does not
exist in the graph. For example, for a single-source single-destination search,
when one of the endpoints is in a small component (\eg the endpoint is an
isolated vertice), systems using a bidirectional search algorithm can quickly
determine that there is no path to be found.
