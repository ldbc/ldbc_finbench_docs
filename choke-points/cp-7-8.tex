\cpSection{7.8}{QEXE}{Reachability between disconnected components}

For path finding queries, the result is often that the specified path does not exist in the graph.
For example, for a single-source single-destination search, when one of the endpoints is in a small component (\eg the endpoint is an isolated node), systems using a bidirectional search algorithm can quickly determine that there is no path to be found.
