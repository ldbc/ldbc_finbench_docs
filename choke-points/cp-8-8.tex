\newCPSection{8.8}{LANG}{Recursive path filtering pattern}

Sometimes when tracing a fund flow, such pattern is expected that find a path
with recursive filters. For example, filters are expected assuming a path A
-[${e_1}$]-> B -[${e_2}$]-> ... -> X.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The timestamp order: ${e_1}$ < ${e_2}$ < … < ${e_i}$
    \item The amount order: ${e_1}$ > ${e_2}$ > … > ${e_i}$
    \item The time window: ${e_{i-1}}$ < ${e_i}$ < ${e_{i-1}}$ + $\vec{\Delta}$,
    $\vec{\Delta}$ is a given constant.
\end{itemize}


The feature that supporting backward recursive filtering based on edge
properties is expected. A possible solution is adding keywords like
\emph{SEQUENTIAL} and \emph{DELTA} referring to an extension of
\emph{Cypher}\cite{tcypher}.
