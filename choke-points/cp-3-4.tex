\newCPSection{3.4}{STORAGE}{Temporal access locality and performance}

When filtering edge in navigational pattern on a high-degree vertex, the
performance of queries with temporal window filters can be improved when the
edges are sorted by timestamp in the embedded storage. This placement optimizes
the data access locality for timestamps avoiding scanning.
