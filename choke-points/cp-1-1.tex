\tpcCPSection[1.2]{1.1}{QOPT}{Interesting orders}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to exploit the
interesting orders induced by some operators. Apart from clustered indices
providing key order, other operators also preserve or even induce tuple
orderings. Sort-based operators create new orderings, typically the probe-side
of a hash join conserves its order, etc.
