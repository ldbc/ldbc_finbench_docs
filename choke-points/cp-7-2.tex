\snbCPSection{7.2}{QOPT}{Cardinality estimation of transitive paths}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to properly estimate the cardinality of intermediate results when executing transitive paths. A transitive path may occur in a ``fact table'' or a ``dimension table'' position.
A transitive path may cover a tree or a graph, \eg descendants in a geographical hierarchy \vs graph neighbourhood or transitive closure in a many-to-many connected social network.
In order to decide proper join order and type, the cardinality of the expansion of the transitive path needs to be correctly estimated.
This could for example take the form of executing on a sample of the data in the
cost model or of gathering special statistics, \eg the depth and fan-out of a tree. In the case of hierarchical dimensions,
\eg geographic locations or other hierarchical classifications, detecting the cardinality of the transitive path will allow one to go to a star schema plan with scan of a fact table with a selective hash join.
Such a plan will be on the other hand very bad for example if the hash table is much larger than the ``fact table'' being scanned.
