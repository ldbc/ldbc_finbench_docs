\snbCPSection{8.2}{LANG}{Complex aggregations}

\paragraph{Description.}

BI workloads are heavy on aggregation, including queries with \emph{subsequent
    aggregations}, where the results of an aggregation serves as the input of
another aggregation. Expressing such operations requires some sort of query
composition or chaining (see also CP-8.4). It is also common to \emph{filter on
aggregation results} (similarly to the \lstinline[language=sql]{HAVING} keyword of SQL).
