\snbCPSection{7.5}{QEXE}{Unweighted shortest paths}

A common problem in graph queries is determining the distance between a vertice and
a set of vertices. To compute the distance values, systems may employ BFS or a
single-source shortest path algorithm with uniform weights. To compute the
distance between two given vertices, systems can use bidirectional search
algorithms.
