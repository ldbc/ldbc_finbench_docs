\snbCPSection{7.5}{QEXE}{Unweighted shortest paths}

A common problem in graph queries is determining the distance between a node and a set of nodes. To compute the distance values, systems may employ BFS or a single-source shortest path algorithm with uniform weights.
To compute the distance between two given node, systems can use bidirectional search algorithms.
