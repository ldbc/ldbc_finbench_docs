\tpcCPSection[1.3]{1.4}{QEXE}{Low cardinality group-by performance}

This choke point tests the ability to efficiently perform group-by evaluation
when only a very limited set of groups is available.  This can require special
strategies for parallelization, \eg pre-aggregation when possible. This case
also allows using special strategies for grouping like using array lookup if the
domain of keys is small.
