\tpcCPSection[5.2]{5.3}{QEXE}{Intra-query result reuse}

This choke point tests the ability of the execution engine to reuse sub-query
results when two sub-queries are mostly identical. Some queries have almost
identical sub-queries, where some of their internal results can be reused in
both sides of the execution plan, thus avoiding to repeat computations.
