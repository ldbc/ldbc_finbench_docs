\snbCPSection{7.1}{QEXE}{Incremental path computation}

This choke point tests the ability of the execution engine to reuse work across
graph traversals. For example, when computing paths within a range of distances,
it is often possible to incrementally compute longer paths by reusing paths of
shorter distances that were already computed.
