\snbCPSection{1.3}{QOPT}{Top-k pushdown}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to perform
optimizations based on top-$k$ selections. Many times queries demand for
returning the top-$k$ elements based on some property. Engines can exploit that
once $k$ results are obtained, extra restrictions in a selection can be added
based on the properties of the $k$th element currently in the top-$k$, being
more restrictive as the query advances, instead of sorting all elements and
picking the highest $k$.
