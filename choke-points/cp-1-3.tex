\cpSection{1.3}{QOPT}{Top-k pushdown}

This choke point tests the ability of the query optimizer to perform optimizations based on top-$k$ selections. Many times queries demand for returning the top-$k$ elements based on some property.
Engines can exploit that once $k$ results are obtained, extra restrictions in a selection can be added based on the properties of the $k$th element currently in the top-$k$, being more restrictive as the query advances, instead of sorting all elements and picking the highest $k$.
