\newCPSection{6.2}{QEXE}{Intra-query parallelization on hub vertex}

When traversing on hub vertex, the number of edges is beyond estimation based on
the degree distribution of the graph. This chokepoint tests the query optimizer
to automate the intra-query parallelization when traversing on hub vertex to
speed up.
