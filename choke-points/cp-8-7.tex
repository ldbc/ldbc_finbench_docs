\newCPSection{8.7}{LANG}{Concise temporal window expression}

Temporal window filtering is a common expression pattern when filtering edges in
navigational pattern. The common scenario is that the whole pattern is expected
bounded by the timestamp filter, including \emph{BEFORE}, \emph{AFTER} and
\emph{BETWEEN}. It is supported that adding timestamp filtering on each vertex
and edge in the pattern to express a temporal window, which is a verbose
expression. A more concise expression is desired. A possible solution is adding
keywords like \emph{RANGE\_SLICE}, \emph{LEFT\_SLICE} and \emph{RIGHT\_SLICE}
referring to an extension of \emph{Cypher}\cite{tcypher}.
