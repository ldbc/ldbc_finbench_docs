\cpSection{8.3}{LANG}{Ranking-style queries}

\paragraph{Description.}

Along with aggregations, BI workloads often use \emph{window functions},
which perform aggregations without grouping input tuples to a single output
tuple.  A common use case for windowing is \emph{ranking}, \ie selecting the top
element with additional values in the tuple (nodes, edges or
attributes).\footnote{PostgreSQL defines the \lstinline[language=sql]{OVER}
    keyword to use aggregation functions as window functions, and the
    \lstinline[language=sql]{rank()} function to produce numerical ranks, see
    \url{https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/tutorial-window.html} for
    details.}
