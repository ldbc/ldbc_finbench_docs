\snbCPSection{3.3}{QEXE}{Scattered index access patterns}

This choke point tests the performance of indices when scattered accesses are
performed. The efficiency of index lookup is very different depending on the
locality of keys coming to the indexed access. Techniques like vectoring
non-local index accesses by simply missing the cache in parallel on multiple
lookups vectored on the same thread may have high impact. Also detecting absence
of locality should turn off any locality dependent optimizations if these are
costly when there is no locality. A graph neighborhood traversal is an example
of an operation with random access without predictable locality.
