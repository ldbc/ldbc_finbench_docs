\newCPSection{8.9}{LANG}{Traversal limit pattern}

When traversing on hub vertex, the data amount touched may experience
exponential growth, which is a common challenge to systems. When the performance
is not enough to satisfy the queries on hub vertex, a language feature is needed
that the number of edges traversed out from the hub vertex can be limited. Such
keyword may be \emph{truncation\_limit}.
