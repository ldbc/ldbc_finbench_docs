\newCPSection{8.9}{LANG}{Traversal limit pattern}

When traversing on hub vertex, the data amount touched may experience exponential growth, which is a common challenge to systems. When the performance is not enough to satisfy the queries on hub vertex, a language feature is needed that the number of edges traversed out from the hub vertex can be limited. Such keyword may be \emph{per\_node\_limit}.
