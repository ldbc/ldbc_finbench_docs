\cpSection{7.6}{QEXE}{Weighted shortest paths}

Computing single-source shortest path is a fundamental problem in graph queries. While there are well-known algorithms to compute it, \eg Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm, system often use na\"ive approaches such as enumerating all paths which makes these queries intractable.
