\section*{Introduction}

Choke points are a superset of LdbcDeliverable with the exception of CP
\chokePoint{7.1}, which was removed and replaced with a new choke point. The
correlations between choke points and queries are displayed in
\autoref{tab:query_choke_point}.

\section{Path Filtering}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\cpSection[1.1]{1.1}{TBFE}{Timestamp-based and amount-based filter on edges}

Almost all the edges has property Timestamp and the transfer edges has property
Amount. Timestamp and amount property is used in filtering.

\cpSection[1.2]{1.2}{RFBD}{Recursive Filtering with backward dependency in variable-length paths}

In some cases, there are some special pattern that is typical in financial
scenarios. Take Transaction/read/11 for example. In this query, it is supposed there
are paths from the start Account Node to other Account Node at most 3 steps via
Transfer relationship. These paths should meet these requirements or patterns:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All money-transfer paths A ->[e1]->B-[e2]->...->X  in which the
	timestamp of each transfer ei  is larger than that of ei-1
	\item All money-transfer paths A ->[e1]->B-[e2]->...->X  in which the amount
	of each transfer ei  is smaller than that of ei-1
\end{itemize}

These cases contain this pattern: Transaction / read / [1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11,13]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\cpSection[1.3]{1.3}{RPQ}{Regular Path Query}

In some cases, the edges may be of different type in variant-length paths, e.g.,
paths like A ->[e1]->B-[e2]->...->X in  which the type of ei  is transfer and
the type of ei-1  is withdraw. When the types varies, it is supposed to support
query using regular expressions. Examples cases: Transaction / read / 11
