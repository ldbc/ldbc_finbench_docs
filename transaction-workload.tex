\chapter{Transaction Workload}
\label{sec:transaction-workload}

This workload consists of a set of relatively simple read queries, write queries
and read-write operations, that touch a significant amount of data. These
queries and operations are usually considered as online data processing and
analysis in online financial systems. The LDBC FinBench transaction workload
consists of four query types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex read queries. See \autoref{sec:complex-read-queries}. This
          section contains many basic read queries that are typical in financial
          scenarios.
    \item Simple read queries. See \autoref{sec:simple-read-queries}. This
          section contains many basic read queries that are typical in financial
          scenarios.
    \item Write queries. See \autoref{sec:write-queries}. This section contains
          many basic write queries that are typical in financial scenarios.
    \item Read-write queries. See \autoref{sec:rw-queries}. This section
          contains many read-write operations composed of basic reads and writes
          in section 4.1 and 4.2. In each operation, the basic reads and writes
          are supposed to launch step by step consecutively. The result may be
          wrong if the previous reads and writes are not be processed accurately
          in time. This feature is a big difference between \ldbcfinbench and
          \ldbcsnb.
\end{itemize}

{\flushleft \textbf{About the truncation:}} Among the queries, a mechanism is
introduced that helps handling the discordance between the tight latency requirements
and power-law distribution of data in system, where the degree of hub vertex may
reach to million and even billion scale, especially when traversing on graph.
The mechanism is to do truncation on the edges when traversing out from the
current vertex, which is in compliance with the discordance in fact. However, we
would like to introduce this mechanism because the high degree of hub vertex is
a common feature not only in financial scenarios but also in other scenarios,
which is an inevitable challenge that systems face. The mechanism is also called
\textbf{PER\_NODE\_LIMIT} somewhere. To solve the problem, systems can either
improve the performance to satisfy the computation or just cut down the
complexity to meet the latency requirements, where truncation is a common and
useful mechanism. To maintain the consistency of the results, a sort order has
to be specified when truncating. Since in financial graphs, users prefer newer
data in business. It is reasonable that attribute, \textbf{timestamp}, in the
edges is used as the sort order in truncation. In the following queries, some
parameters are added to describe the behavior of truncation cutting down the
complexity including the \textbf{TRUNCATION\_LIMIT} and \textbf{TRUNCATION\_ORDER}.
\textbf{TRUNCATION\_ORDER} can be \textbf{TIME\_ASCENDING, TIME\_DESCENDING,
AMOUNT\_ASCENDING, AMOUNT\_DESCENDING}. At most time, \textbf{TRUNCATION\_ORDER}
is set to \textbf{TIME\_DESCENDING} by default.

{\flushleft \textbf{About the annotations:}} To express the patterns better, the
pattern diagrams are drawn from the perspective of data rather than the matching
pattern in graph. Here are some annotations to each query card in this section.
\begin{itemize}
      \item For each row in the result cell, the second column means the data
      type of returned. If the type is bound with \{\}, it means that the
      result is a set, e.g. \{String\} means a string set is returned.
      \item For each row in the result cell, the third column annotates the
      category of type of result returned, including R short for Raw, A short
      for Aggregated, C short for Calculated, S short for Structural. Among
      them, structural type means types like Path while raw type means basic
      types in contrast.
\end{itemize}
