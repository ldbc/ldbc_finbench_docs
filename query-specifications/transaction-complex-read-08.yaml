title: Transfer trace after loan applied
description: |
  Given a *Loan* and a specified time window between *startTime* and
  *endTime*, trace the fund *transfer* or *withdraw* by at most 3 steps
  from the *account* the *Loan* *deposits*. Note that the transfer paths of
  *edge1*, *edge2*, *edge3* and *edge4* are in a specific time range between
  *startTime* and *endTime*. Amount of each transfers or withdrawals between
  the account and the upstream account should exceed a specified *threshold*
  of the upstream transfer. Return all the accounts' id in the downstream of
  loan with the final ratio and distanceFromLoan.
 
  Note: Upstream of an edge refers to the aggregated total amounts of all *transfer-in* edges of its source *Account*.
