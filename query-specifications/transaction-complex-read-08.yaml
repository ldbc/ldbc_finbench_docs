title: Transfer trace after loan applied
description: |
  Given a *Loan* and a specified time window between *start_time* and
  *end_time*, trace the fund *transfer* or *withdraw* by at most 3 steps
  from the *account* the *Loan* *deposits*. Note that the transfer paths of
  *edge1*, *edge2*, *edge3* and *edge4* are in a specific time range between
  *start_time* and *end_time*. Amount of each transfers or withdrawals between
  the account and the upstream account should exceed a specified *threshold*
  of the upstream transfer. Return all the accounts' id in the downstream of
  loan, their final ratio and their distanceFromLoan.
 
  Note: Upstream means the last edge in the trace.
