title: Transfer trace after loan applied
description: |
  Given a *Loan* and a specified time window between *start_time* and
  *end_time*, trace the fund *transfer* or *withdraw* by at most 3 steps
  from the *account* the *Loan* *deposits*. Note that the transfer paths of
  *edge1*, *edge2*, *edge3* and *edge4* are in a specific time range between
  *start_time* and *end_time*. Amount of each transfers or withdrawals between
  the account and the upstream account should exceed a specified *ratio* of the
  upstream transfer. Return all the amount *ratio* (*ratio1*, *ratio2*, and
  *ratio3*) groupby the *accounts*'s id at each step in descending order.

  Note: Upstream means the last edge in the trace.
