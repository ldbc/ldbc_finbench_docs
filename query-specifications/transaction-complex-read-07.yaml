description: | 
  Given an *Account* and a specified time window between *start_time* and
  *end_time*, find all the *transfer-in*(*e1*) and *transfer-out*(*e2*) whose
  amount exceeds *threshold*. Return the count of *src* and *dst* accounts and
  the ratio of *transfer-in* amount over *transfer-out* amount.
