title: Transfer in/out ratio
description: | 
  Given an *Account* and a specified time window between *startTime* and
  *endTime*, find all the *transfer-in* (*edge1*) and *transfer-out* (*edge2*) whose
  amount exceeds *threshold*. Return the count of *src* and *dst* accounts and
  the ratio of *transfer-in* amount over *transfer-out* amount. The fast-in and
  fash-out means a tight window between *startTime* and *endTime*. Return the ratio
  as -1 if there is no *edge2*.
