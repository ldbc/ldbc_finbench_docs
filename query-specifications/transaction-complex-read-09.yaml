title: Money laundering with loan involved
description: |
  Given an *account*, a bound of transfer amount and a specified time window between
  *start_time* and *end_time*, find the *despoit* and *repay* edge between the *account*
  and a *loan*, the *transfers-in* and *transfers-out*. Then calculate the amount ratio
  of *deposit* over *repay*(sum of *edge1* over sum of *edge2*), the amount ratio of 
  *transfers-in* over *transfers-out*(sum of *edge3* over sum of *edge4*), the amount
  ratio of *deposit* over *transfers-out*(sum of *edge1* over sum of *edge4* ). Return
  the ratios.
