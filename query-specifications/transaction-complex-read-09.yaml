description: |
  Given an *account* and a specified time window between *start_time* and
  *end_time*, find the *despoit* and *repay* edge between the *account* and a
  *loan*, the *transfers-in* and *transfers-out*. Then calculate the amount
  ratio of *deposit* over *repay*, the amount ratio of *transfers-in* over
  *transfers-out*, the amount ratio of *deposit* over *transfers-out*. Return
  the ratios.
