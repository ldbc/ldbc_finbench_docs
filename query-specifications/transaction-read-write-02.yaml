  With the reads and writes, this query works as:
  * With Transaction / Read / 22, blocked status of related account is read.
  * With Transaction / write / 3, many transfer edges are inserted. Then enough transfer-out edges from the blocked and unblocked accounts are inserted to the target account.
  * With Transaction / read / 6, many transfer-outs is detected and the ratio of the account transfer-ins from blocked account in all transfer-ins is calculated.
  * When the ratio exceeds a threshold, Transaction / write / 10 is triggered to mark the account as blocked.
