  The workflow of this read write query contains at least one transaction. It works as:

  * In the very beginning, read the blocked status of related accounts. The transaction
  aborts if one of them is blocked. Move to the next step if none is blocked.
  * Add a transfer edge inside the transaction.
  * Detect if a fast-in and fast-out pattern formed, both for the src and dst account.
  Transaction aborts if formed, and then mark the related accounts as blocked in
  another transaction. Otherwise the transaction commits.
