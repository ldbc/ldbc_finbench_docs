  The workflow of this read write query contains at least one transaction. It works as:

  * In the very beginning, read the blocked status of related accounts. The transaction aborts if one of them is
  blocked. Move to the next step if none is blocked.
  * Add a transfer edge inside the transaction.
  * Detect if a fast-in and fast-out pattern formed. Transaction aborts if formed, and then mark the related accounts as
  blocked in another transaction. Otherwise the transaction commits.
