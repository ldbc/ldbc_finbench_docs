title: Final share analysis in investor relationship
description: |
  Given a *Company*, find all the *Companies* and *Persons* investing in
  the *Company* via at most $k$ steps. Then calculate the final share ratio of the
  investors to the given company grouped by the investor in descending order.
  The final share ratio means the final shareholding ratio of each investor in
  the company.

  Note: The final shareholding ratio means the final ratio calculated recursively.
  For example, A owns 50% of B and 50% C while B owns 60% of D and C owns 40% of D.
  Then A owns 50% of D indirectly. 50% is the final shareholding ratio of A in D.
