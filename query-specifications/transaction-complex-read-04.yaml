description: |
  Given two *accounts* and a specified time window between *start_time* and
  *end_time*, find the sum and max of transfers (*edge2* and *edge3*) of them
  via another account (*otherN*) in a specific time range between *start_time*
  and *end_time*. Return the id of the other account, the sum and max of the
  transfer amount (*edge2* and *edge3*). Return -1 for all result attributes
  if there are no transfers found.
