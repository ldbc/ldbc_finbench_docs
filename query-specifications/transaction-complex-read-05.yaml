title: Exact Account Transfer Trace
description: |
  Given a *Person* and a specified time window between *startTime* and
  *endTime*, find the transfer trace from the account (*src*) owned by the
  *Person* to another account (*dst*) by at most 3 steps. Note that the
  trace (*edge2*) must be ascending order of their timestamps. Return all
  the transfer traces.
  
  Note: Multiple edges of from the same src to the same dst should be seen as 
  identical path. And the resulting paths shall not include recurring accounts
  (cycles in the trace are not allowed).
