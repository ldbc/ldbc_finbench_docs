description: |
  Given two *accounts* and a specified time window between *start_time* and
  *end_time*, find the length of shortest path between these two *accounts* by
  the *transfer* relationships. Note that all the edges in the path should be in
  the time window and of type *transfer*. If there is no path found, return -1.
