title: Shortest transfer path
description: |
  Given two *accounts* and a specified time window between *startTime* and
  *endTime*, find the length of shortest path between these two *accounts* by
  the *transfer* relationships. Note that all the edges in the path should be in
  the time window and of type *transfer*. Return 1 if src and dst are directly
  connected. Return -1 if there is no path found.
