  The workflow of this read write query contains at least one transaction. It works as:

  * In the very beginning, read the blocked status of related persons. The transaction aborts if one of them is
  blocked. Move to the next step if none is blocked.
  * Add a guarantee edge between the two persons inside the transaction.
  * Detect if a guarantee chain pattern formed. Calculate if the amount sum of the related loans in the chain exceeds a
  given threshold. Transaction aborts if the sum exceeds the threshold, and then mark the related persons as blocked in another transaction. Otherwise the transaction commits.
