  The workflow of this read write query contains at least one transaction. It works as:

  * In the very beginning, read the blocked status of related persons with given ids of two *src* and *dst* persons. The
  transaction aborts if one of them is blocked. Move to the next step if none is blocked.
  * Add a guarantee edge between the *src* and *dst* persons inside a transaction. Given a specified time window between
  *startTime* and *endTime*, find all the persons in the guarantee chain of until end and their loans applied. Detect if
  a guarantee chain pattern formed, only for the *src* person. Calculate if the amount sum of the related loans in the
  chain exceeds a given threshold. Transaction aborts if the sum exceeds the threshold. Otherwise the transaction commits.
  * If the last transaction aborts, mark the *src* and *dst* persons as blocked in another transaction.
