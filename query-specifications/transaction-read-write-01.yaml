  The workflow of this read write query contains at least one transaction. It works as:

  * In the very beginning, read the blocked status of related accounts. The transaction aborts if one of them is
  blocked. Move to the next step if none is blocked.
  * Add a transfer edge inside the transaction.
  * Detect if a new transfer cycle formed (which means there are no edges existing between the related accounts before).
  Transaction aborts if formed, and then mark the related accounts as blocked in another transaction. Otherwise the
  transaction commits.
