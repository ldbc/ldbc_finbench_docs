  With the reads and writes, this query works as:
  * With Transaction / Read / 22, blocked status of related account is read.
  * With Transaction / write / 3, many transfer edges are inserted. And with enough transfer edges inserted, a transfer cycle via a third-party is formed.
  * With Transaction / read / 4, a three accounts cycle is detected and the sum of transferred fund amount is calculated.
  * When the amount sum exceeds a threshold, Transaction / write / 10 is triggered to mark all the account in the cycle as blocked.
parameters:
  - name: threshold of amount sum
    type: Float
